# Soap game
Incremental game about making soap 

# Features: 
- Shitty css 
- No dark mode 
- Spaghetti code which will make any seasoned developer cry 
- Ignorance of typescript's type system
- Cringeworthy humour

# Why i made this 
- im tired of seeing the lack of browser incrementals on r/incremental_games 
- im tired of ai generated incremental games
- i need money 
- i need that scholarship 
- i need friends :(
