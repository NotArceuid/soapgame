		unplayable because of its confusing UI.
	</h1>
	<h1>
		so right, To start playing the game, you gotta press on the [ soap ] button
		on the top
	</h1>
	<h1>
		After this ah.. you gonna press the [produce] button at the bottom. If you
		can't see it, it's called a skill issue
	</h1>
	<h1>
		Ok so now you should see theres a drop down in between the long box and the
		[ Making: ] tag.
	</h1>
	<h1>Press it. and select Red Soap</h1>

	<h1>Congrats, now you can make soap.</h1>

	<br />

	<h1>
		Ok now to ACTUALLY make money. you need to press the sell button on the left
		and sell your soap
	</h1>
	<h1>Congrats, you now passed the tutorial</h1>

	<br />
	<h1 class="underline">1.2 Consume</h1>
	<h1>
		Ok so.. you've probably seen the button besides the sell button called
		consume right?
	</h1>
	<h1>And you're probably wondering wtf does it do.</h1>
	<h1>
		Consume is a mechanic that allows you to gain certain buffs and multipliers
		such as money bonus/ speed bonus
	</h1>
	<h1>This feature is VERYY powerful.</h1>
